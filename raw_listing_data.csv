<p>Royalties for this asset are reported by PRS in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).</p>

<p>Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor. The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding here. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Distribution Schedule</strong>: PRS regularly distributes royalties four times per year: April, July, October, and December. PRS may pay &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions at various times of the year. These dates are estimated (not fixed) and can vary throughout the year. As the winning bidder, you&#39;ll be entitled to all regularly scheduled and &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>APRA pays on a quarterly basis, with four regular payments each calendar year in February, May, August, and November for&nbsp;royalties from APRA territories (Australia, New Zealand and Pacific territories).

When an account is in an unrecouped state, monthly statements are not issued. Instead, those earnings are reported as part of the next quarterly distribution. Future royalties for this account will be paid monthly for royalties outside APRA territories and quarterly for APRA territories.</p>

<p>This asset earns from music written for the award-winning&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>film franchise. The catalog generates royalties when the films air on TV, is streamed online, when this music is streamed in the films&rsquo; soundtracks and anytime the music plays&nbsp;on Shrek&rsquo;s theme park rides.</p>

<p>The catalog collects royalties from the four feature films:&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shrek 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shrek the Third</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shrek Forever After</em>. It also earns from the holiday TV special&nbsp;<em>Shrek The Halls&nbsp;</em>and any time this music is used in other TV, film, or commercial programming. For example, a scene of&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>is prominently featured in the 2007 Will Smith movie&nbsp;<em>I Am Legend</em>. Subsequently, this catalog earns a public performance royalty when&nbsp;<em>I am Legend</em>&nbsp;airs on TV or is streamed as well.<br />
