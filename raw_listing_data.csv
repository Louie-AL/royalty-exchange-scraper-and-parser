His work is celebrated for its unique blend of pop and electronic music, infused with deep lyrical content that often explores themes of faith, hope, and redemption. Throughout his career, Thulin has received critical acclaim and several nominations for prestigious awards. Notably, he was nominated for three We Love Christian Music Awards, including Best Male Artist, Best Collaboration for &quot;Dead Come to Life&quot; (featuring Charmaine), and Best Music Video for &quot;Bombs Away&quot; (featuring Rachael Lampa). This listing includes all the songs from Jonathan Thulin&#39;s most notable albums: <em>The Anatomy of a Heartflow&nbsp;</em>(2012),&nbsp;<em>The White Room&nbsp;</em>(2013), and&nbsp;<em>Science Fiction&nbsp;</em>(2015).</p>

<p>&quot;Jekyll and Hyde&quot; was released in 2015 as part of Thulin&#39;s album <em>Science Fiction</em>. The song features New Zeeland Christian band, Rapture Ruckus and explores the internal struggle between conflicting parts of one&#39;s personality, much like the famous characters Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. &quot;Hat Trick,&rdquo; featuring Derek Minor, is another standout track from <em>Science Fiction</em>. Thulin&#39;s evocative lyrics are complemented by Derek Minor&#39;s rap, which adds depth to the narrative by highlighting the pressures and consequences of maintaining a facade. &quot;Architecture&quot; was released in 2013 as part of the album <em>The White Room</em>. It is a powerful and introspective track that explores themes of love, support, and resilience.&nbsp;</p>",500.00,2024-06-25T17:01:01.302201Z,,0.1500,62374,filled,life_of_rights,,,https://dh22twu0ekfg6.cloudfront.net/media/orderbook/listings/5739/17549_large.webp,Jonathan Thulin - Sound Recording Royalties,44,3,5430.0,2025-01-16T20:26:35.412743Z,12,9.92,"2022-01-01,2022-02-01,2022-03-01,2022-04-01,2022-05-01,2022-06-01,2022-07-01,2022-08-01,2022-09-01,2022-10-01,2022-11-01,2022-12-01,2023-01-01,2023-02-01,2023-03-01,2023-04-01,2023-05-01,2023-06-01,2023-07-01,2023-08-01,2023-09-01,2023-10-01,2023-11-01,2023-12-01,2024-01-01,2024-02-01,2024-03-01,2024-04-01,2024-05-01","0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.0,0.0,0.0075,0.0,0.0,24.6075,0.015,0.0,0.0,30.54,0.0,0.0","0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1855.17,1188.705,217.8225,522.6525,127.4325,220.1475,125.1375,246.1575,135.99,232.2375,169.1175,131.6475,236.745,120.84,188.9625,146.43,110.6475","813.6136,858.12,783.0574,1161.71,859.8692,819.92,806.0,800.5344,754.5843,747.7508,781.0493,727.9455,669.6198,710.3206,659.0496,699.6319,688.6035,641.2746,594.8937,688.248,616.3106,621.414,608.3869,563.1989,491.2615,581.361,518.9963,571.8573,562.0534","813.6136,858.12,783.0574,1161.71,859.8692,819.92,806.0,800.5344,754.5843,747.7508,781.0493,727.9455,2524.7898,1899.0256,876.8721,1222.2844,816.096,861.4221,720.0312,934.413,752.3006,853.6515,802.1119,694.8614,728.0065,702.201,738.4988,718.2873,672.7009","Jekyll And Hyde,Hat Trick,Architecture,Compass,Dead Come To Life,OTHER","2415.69,1216.34,796.92,795.51,791.35,3162.65","STREAMING,INTERNATIONAL,STREAMING VIDEO,RETAIL MUSIC SERVICE,OTHER","7018.12,2064.06,7.35,3.43,85.52",SOUND RECORDING,9178.49,"SPOTIFY,APPLE MUSIC,YOUTUBE,AMAZON,PANDORA,OTHER","3095.19,1509.23,1358.23,714.91,168.21,2332.72"
