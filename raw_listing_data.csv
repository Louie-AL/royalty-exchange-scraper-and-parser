This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

The band consists of Matt Shultz (vocals), his brother Brad Shultz (rhythm guitar), Nick Bockrath (lead guitar), Matthan Minster (guitar, keyboards), Daniel Tichenor (bass), and Jared Champion (drums).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early in their career, the band signed with Relentless Records after showcasing at the 2007 South by Southwest music festival and supported Queens of the Stone Age on tour. Their 2008 self-titled debut album featured the single &quot;Ain&#39;t No Rest for the Wicked,&quot; which was included in the video game &quot;Borderlands&quot; and the 2010 movie &quot;The Bounty Hunter.&quot;</p>

<p>The band&#39;s second album, &quot;Thank You, Happy Birthday,&quot; debuted at Number 2 on the Billboard 200 in 2011 and received positive reception from most critics. It was heavily influenced by punk rock and bands like Pixies and Nirvana. The band supported the album with performances on late-night shows and at music festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury. They also toured with the Foo Fighters, and their hit song &quot;Shake Me Down&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 2011​​.</p>

<p>Their third album, &quot;Melophobia,&quot; came out in 2013, followed by &quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Pretty,&quot; produced by Dan Auerbach, in 2015.

Cage the Elephant has won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album twice, once in 2017 for &quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Pretty&quot; and again in 2020 for &quot;Social Cues&quot;​​.</p>

<p>Regarding their cultural impact, Cage the Elephant is known for subverting expectations and not adhering to traditional rock band narratives.

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W.

The band consists of Matt Shultz (vocals), his brother Brad Shultz (rhythm guitar), Nick Bockrath (lead guitar), Matthan Minster (guitar, keyboards), Daniel Tichenor (bass), and Jared Champion (drums).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early in their career, the band signed with Relentless Records after showcasing at the 2007 South by Southwest music festival and supported Queens of the Stone Age on tour. Their 2008 self-titled debut album featured the single &quot;Ain&#39;t No Rest for the Wicked,&quot; which was included in the video game &quot;Borderlands&quot; and the 2010 movie &quot;The Bounty Hunter.&quot;</p>

<p>The band&#39;s second album, &quot;Thank You, Happy Birthday,&quot; debuted at Number 2 on the Billboard 200 in 2011 and received positive reception from most critics. It was heavily influenced by punk rock and bands like Pixies and Nirvana. The band supported the album with performances on late-night shows and at music festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury. They also toured with the Foo Fighters, and their hit song &quot;Shake Me Down&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 2011​​.</p>

<p>Their third album, &quot;Melophobia,&quot; came out in 2013, followed by &quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Pretty,&quot; produced by Dan Auerbach, in 2015. Not included in this catalog is &quot;Social Cues,&quot; their fifth studio album, released in 2019. Cage the Elephant has won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album twice, once in 2017 for &quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Pretty&quot; and again in 2020 for &quot;Social Cues&quot;​​.</p>

<p>Regarding their cultural impact, Cage the Elephant is known for subverting expectations and not adhering to traditional rock band narratives. Their album &quot;Social Cues&quot; deals with themes like a breakup and the perils of fame but does so with breezy vibes and funky rhythms. Frontman Matt Shultz emphasizes not being confined to the rock genre or any genre-based titles, reflecting a broader trend in contemporary music.</p>

<p>Cage the Elephant&#39;s journey from a Kentucky indie band to Grammy-winning artists is marked by their eclectic musical influences, willingness to evolve, and energetic live performances. Their approach to music, which transcends genre boundaries and embraces change, reflects and contributes to the broader shifts in the contemporary music landscape.</p>",200,2023-11-29T18:08:34.944866Z,,0.08,139572,filled,life_of_rights,,,,Cage The Elephant - Publishing Royalties,46,11,4985,2025-01-16T20:26:35.412743Z,5416,

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>Officially released in 1987, Cherry Garcia is a nod to the celebrated and acclaimed guitarist/songwriter&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia"" target=""_blank""><u>Jerry Garcia</u></a>, along with his band the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead"" target=""_blank""><u>Grateful Dead</u></a>. The flavor was an instant hit. Over 30 years later, it remains one of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s most popular and &ldquo;longest-serving&rdquo; products.</p>

<p><strong>How The Asset Earns.&nbsp;</strong>These consistent earnings come from the licensing of the Cherry Garcia trademark. This means the winning bidder will earn royalties from the gross sales of all Cherry Garcia-related products under the Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s line. Currently, Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s offers five variations of the Cherry Garcia flavor: ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice cream treats, non-dairy and light ice cream, along with merchandise. Essentially, whenever Cherry Garcia ice cream (or any of its variations) is sold, you&#39;ll earn royalties.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Special Note.&nbsp;</strong>A portion of the proceeds from this listing will support the production of the next music release project produced by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.jerrygarciamusicarts.com/"" target=""_blank""><u>Jerry Garcia Music Arts</u></a>. Jerry Garcia Music Arts is an environmentally conscious, mission-based, music and arts entertainment services company.</p>

<p>Finally, as a special and exciting memento, the seller would like to include a unique piece of Jerry Garcia&#39;s artwork for the winner of this listing.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>Officially released in 1987, Cherry Garcia is a nod to the celebrated and acclaimed guitarist/songwriter&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia"" target=""_blank""><u>Jerry Garcia</u></a>, along with his band the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead"" target=""_blank""><u>Grateful Dead</u></a>. The flavor was an instant hit. Over 30 years later, it remains one of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s most popular and &ldquo;longest-serving&rdquo; products.</p>

<p><strong>How The Asset Earns.&nbsp;</strong>These consistent earnings come from the licensing of the Cherry Garcia trademark. This means the winning bidder will earn royalties from the gross sales of all Cherry Garcia-related products under the Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s line. Currently, Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s offers five variations of the Cherry Garcia flavor: ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice cream treats, non-dairy and light ice cream, along with merchandise. Essentially, whenever Cherry Garcia ice cream (or any of its variations) is sold, you&#39;ll earn royalties.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Special Note.&nbsp;</strong>A portion of the proceeds from this listing will support the production of the next music release project produced by&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.jerrygarciamusicarts.com/"" target=""_blank""><u>Jerry Garcia Music Arts</u></a>. Jerry Garcia Music Arts is an environmentally conscious, mission-based, music and arts entertainment services company.</p>

<p>Finally, as a special and exciting memento, the seller would like to include a unique piece of Jerry Garcia&#39;s artwork for the winner of this listing.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS BEING SOLD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Profit participation income in the TV series &quot;Glee.&quot; Profit participation is the right to receive a share of profits generated by a film or TV project. Producers, actors, showrunners, and other important contributors to a film or TV project enter into an agreement with the studio to receive a portion of the profits in return for their work on the project. &quot;Glee&quot; is distributed and monetized by Twentieth Century Fox and you&rsquo;ll receive income based on the profits generated by the show.</p>

<p>Income is generated when:</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">&quot;Glee&quot; airs on broadcast television&nbsp;</li>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">&quot;Glee&quot; is watched on video streaming platforms</li>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">Music created for &quot;Glee&quot; is used (including music publishing and sound recording royalties)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: The participation income is dependent upon the series&rsquo; proceeds exceeding its costs and expenses. This calculation is done by the distributor of the series.&nbsp;</p>

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What is Being Sold?</strong></h3>

<p>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Asset</strong></h3>

<p>The history of Listerine brand royalties is one of contract law legend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is your chance to be part of this exclusive group.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Payment Schedule</strong></h3>

<p>U.S. generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported in Australian Dollars from&nbsp;Kobalt Australia.&nbsp;To calculate the royalty payments in U.S. Dollars, Royalty Exchange applied the average historical foreign exchange rate&nbsp;for the&nbsp;distribution month&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.x-rates.com/""><u>X-rates.com</u></a>).</p>

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Australian Dollars, converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp;<em>Please note: the receiving bank may mark-up the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Australia, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding&nbsp;<a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home""><u>here</u></a>. Since all investors&rsquo; tax situations are different, please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;International royalties denoted below are earned outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Sweden, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile.

<p>The seller&rsquo;s interest in the musical composition copyrights, including the publisher&rsquo;s share of all publishing royalties, in the songs &ldquo;Home&rdquo; by Machine Gun Kelly and &ldquo;Empty&rdquo; by &ldquo;Kiiara.&rdquo; For &ldquo;Home&rdquo;, the seller owns 9.5% of the total composition copyright (which equals 50% of songwriter Robert Gillies&rsquo; interest). For &ldquo;Empty&rdquo;, the seller owns 13.33% of the total composition copyright (which equals 50% of songwriter Eben Wares&rsquo; interest). In both cases, the seller holds 100% of the writers&rsquo; administration rights in the songs for life of copyright. Copies of the seller&rsquo;s publishing agreements with the songwriters are available upon request. (The songwriter&rsquo;s share of public performance royalties is excluded from the sale.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MATCHING RIGHT&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The seller&#39;s publishing administrator, Warner/Chappell, holds a matching right on any sale of these rights. The publisher will have the opportunity to match any accepted offer within 20 days after acceptance and must decline their matching right before you will be able to complete your purchase. For more information on how the matching right works or to review a copy of the W/C administration agreement, please email: <a href=""mailto:info@royaltyexchange.com"" style=""text-decoration:none""><u>info@royaltyexchange.com</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTE ABOUT ONGOING ADMINISTRATION &amp; PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>

<p>If Warner/Chappell waives their matching right, the purchaser will have the opportunity to enter a new administration agreement with W/C or move the catalog to an administrator of their choice. W/C&rsquo;s current administration fee is 10% of income (15% of sync if procured by W/C). If the W/C agreement is terminated, W/C will have a two-year post-termination retention period followed by a one-year collection period.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: As owner of the copyright, the purchaser will have the obligation to pay &ndash; or direct their administrator to pay &ndash; 50% of the net income to each of the songwriters. Royalty data in this listing reflects 50% of net income. If you do not have a publishing administrator, Royalty Exchange can offer the service through our administrator, Kobalt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOTE ABOUT INVESTMENT TERM</strong></p>

<p>The investment term is &ldquo;at least 30 years&rdquo; because U.S. copyright law gives artists and songwriters the right to terminate a copyright assignment after 35 years. The songwriters of &ldquo;Home&rdquo; and &ldquo;Empty&rdquo; may have the right to terminate the original copyright assignments, which occurred in 2017 and 2020, respectively, beginning in 2052 (35 years from 2017). <a href=""https://futureofmusic.org/article/fact-sheet/right-terminate-musicians%E2%80%99-guide-copyright-reversion"" style=""text-decoration:none""><u>Click here to learn more about copyright termination</u></a>.<br />

<p><strong>EXCHANGE RATES AND FOREIGN TAX WITHHOLDING</strong></p>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported by BMG UK in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).</p>

<p>Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor. The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding <a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported by PRS in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).</p>

<p>Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor. The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding here. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Distribution Schedule</strong>: PRS regularly distributes royalties four times per year: April, July, October, and December. PRS may pay &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions at various times of the year. These dates are estimated (not fixed) and can vary throughout the year. As the winning bidder, you&#39;ll be entitled to all regularly scheduled and &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This asset earns from music written for the award-winning&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>film franchise. The catalog generates royalties when the films air on TV, is streamed online, when this music is streamed in the films&rsquo; soundtracks and anytime the music plays&nbsp;on Shrek&rsquo;s theme park rides.</p>

<p>The catalog collects royalties from the four feature films:&nbsp;<em>Shrek</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shrek 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Shrek the Third</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shrek Forever After</em>. It also earns from the holiday TV special&nbsp;<em>Shrek The Halls&nbsp;</em>and any time this music is used in other TV, film, or commercial programming. For example, a scene of&nbsp;<em>Shrek&nbsp;</em>is prominently featured in the 2007 Will Smith movie&nbsp;<em>I Am Legend</em>. Subsequently, this catalog earns a public performance royalty when&nbsp;<em>I am Legend</em>&nbsp;airs on TV or is streamed as well.<br />

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Swedish Krona converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp;<em>Please note: the receiving bank may mark-up the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Sweden, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding&nbsp;<a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home"" style=""text-decoration:none""><u>here</u></a>. Since all investors&rsquo; tax situations are different, please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;International royalties denoted below are earned outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS BEING SOLD?</strong></p>

<p>The seller&rsquo;s interest in the songwriter&#39;s share of all public performance and mechanical royalties (excluding royalties collected by Nordisk Copyright Bureau) attributable to the musical compositions listed in the Track List below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you missed out on those opportunities &mdash; we now have another chance at a larger portion of the same unique asset!</p>

<h3><strong>What is Being Sold?</strong></h3>

<p>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Asset</strong></h3>

<p>The history of Listerine brand royalties is one of contract law legend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/"" style=""text-decoration:none""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is your chance to be part of this exclusive group.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Payment Schedule</strong></h3>

<p>U.S. generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the first month of every quarter (January, April, July, and October) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.</p>",2022-05-12T00:18:55.102435Z,,5800,2022-04-19T17:01:06.495664Z,,0.085,109471,filled,life_of_rights,,,https://dh22twu0ekfg6.cloudfront.net/media/orderbook/listings/4580/listing_image_lr_large.png,Listerine Mouthwash Royalties,1,16,,2025-01-16T20:26:35.412743Z,4580

<p>With nearly 3 million Spotify listeners monthly, the stability of Bad Company&#39;s catalog appeal amongst Classic Rock enthusiasts is sound and consistent - with no downward trend in sight. Including smash hits such as &#39;Feel Like Makin&#39; Love&#39;, named the 78th &quot;Best Hard Rock Song of All Time&quot; by VH1, &#39;Rock &#39;n&#39;Roll Fantasy&#39;, certified Gold by the RIAA, as well as &quot;Shooting Star&quot; this listing features time-tested standards that help to shape the canon of 20th-century popular music.</p>

<h3><strong>Note About Financial data</strong></h3>

<p>Detailed royalty data is not available for this asset. An accounting firm calculates earnings from Sound Exchange and Bad Company&rsquo;s Live LPs and pays them to each interested party on a quarterly basis. All other label royalties &ndash; the majority of the earnings &ndash; are typically paid as an up-front advance, which is then recouped in subsequent quarters. These advances are not made on a fixed schedule and are at the label and recording artists&rsquo; discretion. The winning bidder will receive this seller&#39;s share of the next advance and all future advances. As the current advance is expected to recoup with the next quarter of label earnings, a new advance is anticipated during 2022. If an advance is not made, label royalties will be paid as earned on the same quarterly schedule as Sound Exchange and Live LPs.</p>

<p><br />
The seller&rsquo;s historical payment amounts from this royalty stream have been verified by the seller&rsquo;s accounting ﬁrm.</p>

<p>This asset includes 100% ownership of the copyright and all related rights and royalties from the independent Christian film &ldquo;<u><a href=""https://www.gobmg.com/product/faiths-song/"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank"">Faith&rsquo;s Song</a>.</u>&rdquo; The film was released theatrically in South Carolina in January 2017. It has since been distributed (both digitally and on DVD) by Bridgestone Multimedia Group (<u><a href=""https://www.gobmg.com/about-us/"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank"">BMG-Global</a></u>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a rare chance to own 100% of an intellectual property asset. Instead of a purely passive royalty interest, the purchaser of this asset will control all rights &ndash; subject to the remaining term of the current distribution agreement &ndash; to the independent Christian film &ldquo;Faith&rsquo;s Song.&rdquo; Owning these rights will allow the purchaser to take an active role in monetizing the film for future profit.</p>

<p>The distribution agreement &ndash; which initially ran for five years and was renewed for a two-year on March 31, 2022 &ndash; provides for a 50/50 net profits split between the seller and BMG-Global. To date, the seller&rsquo;s 50% net profits share has earned $90,108.33. In the last four quarters, the 50% share has earned $20,156.33.</p>

<p>The film has been <u><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Faiths-Song-Hayden-Grace-McCoy/dp/B0719PW9Y1"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank"">well received on Amazon Prime Video</a></u>, with a 4.6/5.0 rating over 346 reviews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another compelling aspect of this asset is that all cast, crew, and investor profit participation agreements &ndash; which were valid for five years from release and expired in April 2022 &ndash; have already been satisfied. That means that aside from the terms of the distribution agreement, the purchaser will own the film and its profits free and clear from any deductions or ongoing payment obligations.</p>

<p>Investors who are verified to bid on the Royalty Exchange marketplace are welcome to review all of the documents associated with the film here:&nbsp;<u><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/usrge705oe2r532/AABc-Kb61P4JTQ2zPi7vuAHya?dl=0"" target=""_blank"">www.dropbox.com</a></u>&nbsp; If you are a verified investor, please email us to request a password to the folder.</p>

<p>The sale will also include all physical materials in the seller&rsquo;s possession, including physical drives containing the raw footage shot on cinema camera and professional DCP master.&nbsp;The seller will ship these materials to the purchaser promptly upon closing.&nbsp; The buyer will also receive digital online master copies with master music.</p>

<p><strong>POST-SALE&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The sale of this asset will include the assignment of the copyright of the film as well as the current distribution agreement with BMG-Global. The purchaser will be responsible for registering the copyright assignment with the U.S. Copyright Office, and will be subject to the exclusive license agreement with BMG-Global for the remainder of the term. The term of the BMG-Global license agreement expires on 3/31/2024 and will automatically renew unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice.</p>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported by BMG UK in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).</p>

<p>Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor. The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding here. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>STIM pays on a quarterly basis, with four regular payments each calendar year in March, June, September, and December. In addition to these quarterly payments,&nbsp;STIM also distributes &quot;out of cycle&quot; payments for digital music services. These dates are estimated (not fixed) and can vary throughout the year.&nbsp;The last 12 months&#39; earnings reflect the total of the payments made in the last calendar year, both regularly scheduled and additional &quot;out of cycle&quot; payments.</p>

<p>The winner of this auction will receive all future distributions for the included works in this offering when paid by STIM.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.stim.se/sv/betalning-och-ersattning-till-upphovspersoner/stims-arsplanering-2021"" target=""_blank"">Read more about STIM&#39;s payment schedule here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2020 ADJUSTMENT</strong></p>

<p>You will notice a significant spike in September 2020. This is the result of a &quot;catch-up&quot; payment for the included works that were released in 2016 or prior but had not been properly registered with STIM until September 2020.<br />
<br />
Once the works were registered with STIM, an adjustment was processed for backed royalties due to the seller. Although this is not expected to occur again, the winning bidder will be entitled to all future royalty payments regardless of when earned. Going forward, all included works have been correctly registered and are fully payable.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>SPOTIFY ADJUSTMENT</strong></h4>

<p>In February 2021, STIM paid an adjustment for&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.stim.se/en/articles/about-our-payment-february-16th"">unreported Spotify&nbsp;earnings from the&nbsp;H2-2017</a>&nbsp;(July - December) performance period.

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported in Swedish Krona from&nbsp;STIM.&nbsp;To calculate the royalty payments in U.S. Dollars, Royalty Exchange applied the average historical foreign exchange rate&nbsp;for the&nbsp;distribution month&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.x-rates.com/"" target=""_blank"">X-rates.com</a>).</p>

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Swedish Krona converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp;<em>Please note: the receiving bank may mark-up the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee.</em>&nbsp;Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seller acquired a 10-year term interest through an <a href=""https://auctions.royaltyexchange.com/auctions/cherry-garcia-ice-cream-trademark-royalties/#Overview"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank""><u>auction in 2020</u></a> and is now selling that interest. This collection term expires on October 27th, 2030, after which the royalties will revert back to the original owner.</p>

<p>Officially released in 1987, Cherry Garcia is a nod to the celebrated and acclaimed guitarist/songwriter <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Garcia"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank""><u>Jerry Garcia</u></a> of the iconic band <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_Dead"" style=""text-decoration:none"" target=""_blank""><u>Grateful Dead</u></a>. The flavor was an instant hit. Over three decades years later, it remains one of Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s most popular and &ldquo;longest-serving&rdquo; products.</p>

<p>These earnings come from the licensing of the Cherry Garcia trademark. This means the winning bidder will earn royalties from the gross sales of all Cherry Garcia-related products under the Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s line. Currently, Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s offers five variations of the Cherry Garcia flavor: ice cream, frozen yogurt, ice cream treats, non-dairy, and light ice cream, along with merchandise. Essentially, whenever Cherry Garcia ice cream (or any of its variations) is sold, you&#39;ll earn royalties.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>WHAT IS BEING SOLD?</strong></h4>

<p>The right to the seller&rsquo;s interest &mdash; which expires October 27th, 2030 &mdash; in the domestic (U.S. only) royalties derived from the licensing of the Cherry Garcia trademark.</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<h4>EXCHANGE RATES AND FOREIGN TAX WITHHOLDING</h4>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported by Universal Music Group in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).<br />
<br />
Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor.&nbsp;The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding here. Please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;<br />

<p><em>The King of Queens</em> premiered on CBS in September 1998 and ran through May 2007, with a total of nine seasons and 207 episodes. The royalties are generated from the theme music (both the opening and closing themes) and from the original underscore (commonly referred to as &quot;cues&quot;) composed for scenes throughout each episode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The series has been airing widely in syndication since 2006 on numerous cable networks in the United States. Currently, the series is available to stream on the premium Peacock app and airs frequently on Fox and The CW affiliates, MyNetworkTV, CMT, TV Land, A&amp;E, and FYI channels. Internationally, the series airs in Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Austria, among others. In the last 12 months, 85% of royalties for this catalog came from domestic (U.S.) airings of the series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to take into consideration that if <em>The&nbsp;King of Queens</em> begins to air less frequently on syndicate networks or stops airing at all, public performance royalties for this catalog would decrease.</p>

<p>One compelling feature of this asset is that it collects royalties from two performing rights societies: BMI and SESAC. This means the winning bidder will collect two sets of quarterly payments for a total of eight (8) distributions per year.</p>

Although this is not expected to occur again, the winning bidder will be entitled to all future royalty payments regardless of when earned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>EXCHANGE RATES AND FOREIGN TAX WITHHOLDING</strong></p>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported in Swedish Krona from&nbsp;STIM.&nbsp;To calculate the royalty payments in U.S. Dollars, Royalty Exchange applied the average historical foreign exchange rate&nbsp;for the&nbsp;distribution month&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.x-rates.com/"" target=""_blank"">X-rates.com</a>).</p>

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Swedish Krona converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp;<em>Please note: the receiving bank may mark-up the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Sweden, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding&nbsp;<a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Since all investors&rsquo; tax situations are different, please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;International royalties denoted below are earned outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p>STIM pays on a quarterly basis, with four regular payments each calendar year in March, June, September, and December. In addition to these quarterly payments,&nbsp;STIM also distributes &quot;out of cycle&quot; payments for digital music services. These dates are estimated (not fixed) and can vary throughout the year.&nbsp;The last 12 months&#39; earnings reflect the total of the payments made in the last calendar year, both regularly scheduled and additional &quot;out of cycle&quot; payments.</p>

<p>The winner of this auction will receive all future distributions for the included works in this offering when paid by STIM.&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.stim.se/sv/betalning-och-ersattning-till-upphovspersoner/stims-arsplanering-2021"" target=""_blank"">Read more about STIM&#39;s payment schedule here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SEPTEMBER 2020 ADJUSTMENT</strong></p>

<p>You will notice a significant spike in September 2020. This is the result of a &quot;catch-up&quot; payment for select works that were released in 2016 or prior but had not been properly registered with STIM until September 2020.<br />
<br />
Once the works were registered with STIM, an adjustment was processed for backed royalties due to the seller. Although this is not expected to occur again, the winning bidder will be entitled to all future royalty payments regardless of when earned.&nbsp;Going forward, all included works have been correctly registered and are fully payable.&nbsp;</p>

Spotify Adjustment</h4>

<p>In February 2021, STIM paid an adjustment for <a href=""https://www.stim.se/en/articles/about-our-payment-february-16th"">unreported Spotify&nbsp;earnings from the&nbsp;H2-2017</a> (July - December) performance period. Although this is not expected to occur again, the winning bidder will be entitled to all future royalty payments regardless of when earned.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>EXCHANGE RATES AND FOREIGN TAX WITHHOLDING</h4>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported in Swedish Krona from&nbsp;STIM.&nbsp;To calculate the royalty payments in U.S. Dollars, Royalty Exchange applied the average historical foreign exchange rate&nbsp;for the&nbsp;distribution month&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.x-rates.com/"" target=""_blank"">X-rates.com</a>).</p>

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Swedish Krona converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp; <strong><em>Please note: the receiving bank may mark-up the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee.</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Sweden, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding&nbsp;<a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Since all investors&rsquo; tax situations are different, please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;International royalties denoted below are earned outside of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>EXCHANGE RATES AND FOREIGN TAX WITHHOLDING</h4>

<p>Royalties for this asset are reported in Great British Pounds&nbsp;from&nbsp;Sony Music Publishing Great Britain.&nbsp;To calculate the royalty payments in U.S. Dollars, Royalty Exchange applied the average historical foreign exchange rate&nbsp;for the&nbsp;distribution month&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.x-rates.com/"" target=""_blank"">X-rates.com</a>).</p>

<p>The future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in Great British Pounds converted to U.S. Dollars upon receipt, and then paid in U.S. Dollars to the winning investor.&nbsp;Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, because the royalty payments originate in Great Britain, the purchaser may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on their domicile. You can learn more about foreign tax withholding&nbsp;<a href=""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/tax-summaries-home"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Since all investors&rsquo; tax situations are different, please consult your tax advisor if you have questions on foreign withholding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall royalties grew 33% year-over-year. This is a result of the <em>Shrek </em>films airing more frequently on cable networks TBS, Nickelodeon, TNT, Bravo, and Paramount networks in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The catalog collects royalties from the four feature films: <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Shrek 2</em>, <em>Shrek the Third</em>, and <em>Shrek Forever After</em>. It also earns from the holiday TV special <em>Shrek The Halls </em>and any time this music is used in other TV, film, or commercial programming. For example, a scene of <em>Shrek </em>is prominently featured in the 2007 Will Smith movie <em>I Am Legend</em>. Subsequently, this catalog earns a public performance royalty when <em>I am Legend</em> airs on TV or is streamed as well.<br />

The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the last month of every quarter (March, June, September, and December) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the last month of every quarter (March, June, September, and December) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.&nbsp; A split of foreign royalties is not being reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson starting in June 2023, as a result, the breakout is estimated based on the historical reporting at 70% International and 30% Domestic in those payment months.&nbsp;<br />

The band consists of Matt Shultz (vocals), his brother Brad Shultz (rhythm guitar), Nick Bockrath (lead guitar), Matthan Minster (guitar, keyboards), Daniel Tichenor (bass), and Jared Champion (drums).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early in their career, the band signed with Relentless Records after showcasing at the 2007 South by Southwest music festival and supported Queens of the Stone Age on tour. Their 2008 self-titled debut album featured the single &quot;Ain&#39;t No Rest for the Wicked,&quot; which was included in the video game &quot;Borderlands&quot; and the 2010 movie &quot;The Bounty Hunter.&quot;</p>

<p>The band&#39;s second album, &quot;Thank You, Happy Birthday,&quot; debuted at Number 2 on the Billboard 200 in 2011 and received positive reception from most critics. It was heavily influenced by punk rock and bands like Pixies and Nirvana. The band supported the album with performances on late-night shows and at music festivals like Coachella and Glastonbury. They also toured with the Foo Fighters, and their hit song &quot;Shake Me Down&quot; was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 2011​​.</p>

<p>Their third album, &quot;Melophobia,&quot; came out in 2013, followed by &quot;Tell Me I&#39;m Pretty,&quot; produced by Dan Auerbach, in 2015.

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the last month of every quarter (March, June, September, and December) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.<br />

This royalty income is derived from what has been called one of the most remarkable business transactions in U.S. business history. As the winning bidder, you&rsquo;ll own a royalty interest in the gross global sales of Listerine Antiseptic mouthwash.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is Being Sold.&nbsp;</strong>A royalty interest in gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic. The royalty interest is derived from an 1881 agreement between the inventor of the Listerine formula and the original distributor of the Listerine product. The royalty agreement calls for a flat rate royalty on worldwide Listerine sales, for as long as Listerine is sold. The agreement has been in effect since 1881, and in 1959 its perpetual nature was upheld in U.S. federal court.</p>

<p><strong>About the Asset.&nbsp;</strong>In 1879, Dr. JJ Lawrence invented Listerine and in 1881, licensed the secret formula to J.W. Lambert and Lambert Pharmaceutical Co., ultimately settling on a royalty based on the number of ounces sold, to be paid to him and his &ldquo;heirs, executors, or assigns&rdquo; for as long as Listerine was sold.</p>

<p>For the next 75 years, the Lawrence family collected these royalties, with the ownership stake splintering between various heirs, some of whom sold portions of their stake to additional owners (such as New York real estate broker John J. Reynolds, who acquired half of the share of these royalties from the Lawrence heirs in 1950).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Lambert Pharmaceutical merged with Warner-Hudnut in 1955, the newly merged management contested the $1.5 million a year they were paying in royalties in court&hellip; <a href=""https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/""><u>a case they famously lost</u></a> in a decision that remains cited in contract law cases and classes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of this decision, the Listerine royalty payments will remain in force for the lifetime of the brand, paid to whoever owns a share. Today, those entities include not only the heirs of the Lawrence family, but also various pension funds, universities, hospitals, and multiple individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Payment Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>U.S.-generated royalties are paid monthly, based on the prior months&rsquo; sales. Royalties from sales in all other countries are paid on a quarterly basis. These sales royalties are calculated on the gross sales of Listerine Antiseptic by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice a spike in payments in the last&nbsp;month of every quarter (March, June, September, and December) due to the quarterly foreign royalty payments.</p>

</div>",2024-08-13T20:35:45.552290Z,"<p>&quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment&quot; (2015)&nbsp;dramatizes the notorious 1971 study led by Dr. Philip Zimbardo, portrayed by Billy Crudup, where college students assigned roles of guards and prisoners quickly spiraled into abusive behaviors, leading to the experiment&#39;s termination after six days. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, winning numerous awards. The score&nbsp;is characterized by its minimalist and haunting style, blending orchestral and electronic elements to enhance the film&#39;s tense atmosphere,&nbsp;earning praise for its contribution to the film&#39;s intense and immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Villains&quot; (2019) is appreciated for its originality, engaging plot, and strong performances, particularly from its lead and supporting cast. It stands out as a darkly comedic take on the home invasion genre, with a twist that keeps viewers engaged and entertained.&nbsp;The score for &quot;Villains&quot; reflects the film&#39;s blend of dark comedy and horror and&nbsp;uses a combination of eerie, suspenseful music to heighten the tension and moments of quirky, offbeat melodies to complement the dark humor. This duality in the score helps to balance the film&#39;s tone, making the shifts between comedy and horror feel seamless.</p>

<p>&quot;Submarine&quot; is a 2010 British coming-of-age comedy-drama directed by Richard Ayoade, based on Joe Dunthorne&#39;s novel. Ayoade&#39;s directorial debut is noted for its quirky humor and distinct visual style, drawing comparisons to Wes Anderson.&nbsp;The score for &quot;Submarine&quot; adds&nbsp;an integral layer to the film&#39;s unique atmosphere. The&nbsp;compositions complement the film&rsquo;s quirky and whimsical tone, enhancing its emotional depth and the overall narrative, and&nbsp;are characterized by its blend of classical and contemporary elements, using a variety of instruments to evoke the film&#39;s mood swings from comedic to poignant moments.</p>",500,2024-06-27T17:09:21.401893Z,,0.1,108733,filled,life_of_rights,,,https://dh22twu0ekfg6.cloudfront.net/media/orderbook/listings/5744/5744_newimage_large.jpg,"Film Scores from Stanford Prison Experiment, Villains, Submarine + more",36,8,5439,2025-01-16T20:26:35.412743Z,5744

Panicland&#39;s musical influences are diverse, drawing inspiration from various genres and artists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the band&#39;s notable achievements is their success in local contests, which helped them gain attention and support within the music industry. This led to the recording of their first full-length album with producer Greig Nori. They released a mixtape titled &quot;MMXIII&quot; in 2013, featuring songs like &quot;Rock Ur Body,&quot; &quot;Hover,&quot; and &quot;Lockets.&quot; The mixtape showcases their ability to blend influences from various musical genres.</p>

<p>Panicland gained wider attention for a unique event in their career involving a metamodern prank. They created a set of fake Green Day songs, managing to convince many Green Day fans that the music was genuine. This act was not intended to mock Green Day but rather served as a tribute to the band, which they admire. The prank was well-received, including by Green Day themselves, who expressed admiration for Panicland&#39;s stunt. This event highlighted Panicland&#39;s creative spirit and ability to engage with popular culture in an innovative way.</p>",900,2023-12-15T18:22:15.579233Z,,0.1,137189,filled,fixed_return,,68322,,Pop/Rock Band - Panicland - Sound Recording Royalties,12,4,5043,2025-01-16T20:26:35.412743Z,5451

&nbsp;</p>

<p>Payment Year &ndash; Annual Cap</p>

<p>Payment Year 1 &ndash; $82,000</p>

<p>Payment Year 2 &ndash; $76,000</p>

<p>Payment Year 3 &ndash; $70,000</p>

<p>Payment Year 4 &ndash; $62,000</p>

<p>If the buyer&rsquo;s&nbsp;payments within a given Payment Year do not reach the Annual Cap, the subsequent Payment Year&#39;s Annual Cap shall be increased by the amount of the prior Payment Year&#39;s shortfall. If the total Recoupment Amount is not reached by the end of Payment Year 4, the buyer shall collect -- uncapped -- 100% of payments for the Assigned Royalties until the Recoupment Amount is reached.<br />
<br />
<strong>Early Repayment.&nbsp;</strong>The seller will retain the right to repay the advance balance in full at any point in the term. For example, if the buyer has collected $82,000 for Payment Year 1, the seller may pay the balance of $208,000 in order to satisfy the terms of the advance and reclaim the royalty stream in full.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note About Earnings.&nbsp;</strong>The earnings from &quot;Radio&quot; are largely attributable to the use of &quot;X Bedz&quot; as a theme/bumper for prominent DJ Chris Moyles. His program is on air six days a week as of the time of this listing&#39;s publication. He has been under contract with Radio X since 2015. Moyles is under contract for another three years.<br />
<br />
<strong>Exchange Rates.&nbsp;</strong>Royalties for this asset are reported by PRS in Great British Pounds (GBP). To calculate royalty payments in U.S. Dollars (USD), Royalty Exchange applies the average historical exchange rate for the distribution month (via X-rates.com).</p>

<p>Future royalties will be paid to Royalty Exchange in GBP converted to USD upon receipt, and then paid in USD to the winning investor. The receiving bank may increase the exchange rate by up to 2.5% as a transaction fee. Assets paid in foreign currency entail additional risk as foreign exchange rate changes will cause fluctuations in future cash flows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Distribution Schedule.&nbsp;</strong>PRS regularly distributes royalties four times per year: April, July, October, and December. PRS may pay &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions at various times of the year. These dates are estimated (not fixed) and can vary throughout the year. As the winning bidder, you&#39;ll be entitled to all regularly scheduled and &quot;out of cycle&quot; distributions.&nbsp;</p>
